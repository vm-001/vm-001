#### ðŸ‘‹ Hi there

From the moment I produced "Hello World" in the console of my first application, I knew I was hooked into the world of software development.


I have 7 years of software development experience across different fields, such as e-commerce, enterprise SaaS, and API Gateway. Over the past years, I

-   break down monolithic systems into microservices
-   implement a RPC framework based on JSON-RPC protocol
-   design database desensitization to meet GDPR compliance
-   develop billing system using Stripe
-   develop distributed tracing

I'm currently hooked on application observability, and learning tracing and profiling.

#### About Me

- I hate learning new programming languages, but I write Go, Lua, Java, Rust, HTML/JavaScript/CSS
- I love building products
- I call myself an investor
- I like chatting with strangers
